    "- Begin with a Seed Set of Human-Written Instructions: Start by compiling a collection of well-crafted instructions that serve as the foundation for generating new tasks. Examples of instructions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - {\"instruction\": \"Design a 3-ingredient snack that meets the specified criteria, and provide a short explanation for each ingredient's role in the snack.\"}\n",
    "    - {\"instruction\": \"Find a healthier alternative for each of the given options.\"}\n",
    "- Generate New Instructions: Utilize a language model to generate a new set of instructions based on the seed tasks. This process involves creating prompts that guide the model to generate instructions similar to the seed tasks. The generated instructions are then filtered to ensure they are not excessively similar to existing instructions using the ROUGE-L similarity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Classify Instructions: Determine whether each instruction corresponds to a classification or non-classification task. This classification is essential for selecting the appropriate template when generating instances for each instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate Instances: For each instruction, use a suitable template (either input-first or output-first) to generate instances. The template is tailored to the task type (classification or non-classification). The generated instances are then extracted from the model's response and added to the metadata of each instruction.\n",
    "    - Here's how a complete instance looks : \n",
    "    - {\"instruction\": \"Design a 3-ingredient snack that meets the specified criteria, and provide a short explanation for each ingredient's role in the snack, \"examples\": [{\"class_label\": \"Sweet & Savory\", \"input\": {\"ingredient1\": \"Apple slices\", \"explain1\": \"Providing natural sweetness and crisp texture\", \"ingredient2\": \"Cheddar cheese\", \"explain2\": \"Adding a rich, savory flavor and creamy texture\", \"ingredient3\": \"Walnuts\", \"explain3\": \"Adding crunch and earthy flavor\"}, \"output\": \"Sweet & Savory\"}, {\"class_label\": \"Sweet Treat\", \"input\": {\"ingredient1\": \"Pineapple chunks\", \"explain1\": \"Adding natural sweetness and juicy texture\", \"ingredient2\": \"Dark chocolate chips\", \"explain2\": \"Providing rich, sweet flavor and indulgent texture\", \"ingredient3\": \"Coconut flakes\", \"explain3\": \"Adding tropical flavor and extra crunch\"}, \"output\": \"Sweet Treat\"}, {\"class_label\": \"Savory Snack\", \"input\": {\"ingredient1\": \"Baby carrots\", \"explain1\": \"Providing crunchy texture and mild sweetness\", \"ingredient2\": \"Cream cheese\", \"explain2\": \"Adding rich, creamy flavor and smooth texture\", \"ingredient3\": \"Chopped pecans\", \"explain3\": \"Adding nutty flavor and extra crunch\"}, \"output\": \"Savory Snack\"}]}\n",

    "\n",
    "In plain English, this code defines two functions that are used to generate instances for a list of data items. The first function, extract_json, is used to extract a JSON object from a response string. The second function, generate_instances, uses a language model to generate instances for each data item based on the instruction and the classification label. The function sends a prompt to the language model, extracts the instances from the response using the extract_json function, and adds the instances to the metadata of the item. Finally, the function saves the updated data to a new JSONL file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extract_json function takes a response string and a prompt string as input, and attempts to extract a JSON object from the response string. It does this by finding the first occurrence of '{' and the last occurrence of '}' in the response string, and then attempting to parse the substring between those indices as a JSON object. If the parsing fails, the function retries up to a maximum number of times (specified by the max_retries parameter). If the function is unable to extract a valid JSON object after the maximum number of retries, it returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "The generate_instances function takes a list of data items, an input-first template string, and an output-first template string as input. It iterates over each item in the data list, and for each item, it generates instances based on the instruction and the classification label. If the classification label is True, the function uses the output-first template to generate instances. If the classification label is False, the function uses the input-first template to generate instances. The function sends a prompt to the make_requests function, which makes a request to the Groq API and returns the response. The function then calls the extract_json function to extract the instances from the response, and adds the instances to the metadata of the item. Finally, the function saves the updated data to a new JSONL file.\n",
